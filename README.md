## Overview

Containerum is open source package manager and UI for Kubernetes. Containerum is built to aid cluster management, teamwork and resource allocation. Containerum runs on top of any Kubernetes cluster and provides a friendly Web UI for cluster management.

Containerum consists of several components:

* **api-gateway** provides routing for Containerum components
* **user-manager** is a service for managing users, groups, credentials, blacklists for Containerum
* **resource** manages Kubernetes namespace objects: deployments, ingresses, etc.
* **permissions** manage user access to enable teamwork
* **kube** is a set of API for communication between Containerum and K8s
* **auth** handles user authorization and token management
* **mail** is a mail client and newsletter template manager
* **ui** is Web User Interface for Containerum
* **chkit** is CLI for Containerum

and 2 databases:
* MongoDB
