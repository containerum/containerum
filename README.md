## Overview

Containerum is an open source platform for the complete management of Kubernetes clusters. Containerum features tools for simple CI/CD pipelines setup, revision control, project and role management. 

- Runs on top of any Kubernetes cluster
- Managed via CLI or intuitive Web UI

Containerum consists of several components:

* [**api-gateway**](https://github.com/containerum/gateway) provides routing for Containerum components
* [**user-manager**](https://github.com/containerum/user-manager) is a service for managing users, groups, credentials, blacklists for Containerum
* [**resource**](https://github.com/containerum/resource) manages Kubernetes namespace objects: deployments, ingresses, etc.
* [**permissions**](https://github.com/containerum/permissions) manage user access to enable teamwork
* [**kube-api**](https://github.com/containerum/kube-api) is a set of API for communication between Containerum and K8s
* [**auth**](https://github.com/containerum/auth) handles user authorization and token management
* [**mail**](https://github.com/containerum/mail) is a mail server and newsletter template manager
* [**ui**](https://github.com/containerum/ui) is Web User Interface for Containerum
* [**chkit**](https://github.com/containerum/chkit) is CLI for Containerum

and 2 databases:
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL

Basically, Containerum architecture looks like this:

## Prerequisites
Before installing Containerum make sure you have the following components:

* Docker
* Kubernetes *1.5 or higher*
* Helm
* Installed [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](ingress.md)

*or*

* You can use [Let's Kube](https://github.com/containerum/letskube) utility to install the latest verions of Docker and Kubernetes on your VMs.

## How to install
To launch Containerum on your Kubernetes Cluster run: 

```
helm repo add containerum https://charts.containerum.io
helm repo update
helm install containerum/containerum
```

This will install the Containerum components and create two Ingresses to expose Containerum. You can view the Ingresses with `kubectl get ingress`.

To be able to reach Containerum Web UI and the API, add the machine IP address to /etc/hosts, e.g.:

```
127.0.0.1 local.containerum.io api.local.containerum.io
```
where ```127.0.0.1``` is the address of your machine with Containerum.

Now you can access Containerum Web UI at ```local.containerum.io```. 

## Getting started
Containerum has an intuitive web interface and a simple but powerful CLI tool. Yet we recommend learning about the [object types](https://docs.containerum.com/getting-started/object-types/) in Containerum as well as the basics of working with [Containerum Web UI](https://docs.containerum.com/web-panel/) and [chkit CLI](https://docs.containerum.com/cli/) in our Docs.

Don't forget to install [chkit CLI](https://github.com/containerum/chkit) (from source code or binaries - whatever you prefer!).
